    <h2>Movie Name:YATRA</h2>
    <img src="Yatra.jpg" alt="YATRA">
    <h2>Review :</h2>
    <h3 style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Yatra is a gripping and engaging emotional ride. The movie showcases YSR’s historical Yatra in realistic manner. But it runs on slow pace. Hence despite some good moments here and there, the film doesn’t glue us to the screens throughout this movie. However, it may work for YSR’s fans as it gives glimpse of leader’s struggles and his achievement.</h3>
    <h2>IMDB Rating :</h2>
    <h3>9.8/10.0</h3>
    <h2>From Actor by:</h2>
    <h3>Mammootty (born 7 September 1951), is an Indian actor and film producer who works predominantly in Malayalam films. </h3>
    <h2>Highlights :</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The second of the major biopics to release in Telugu this year, Yatra, based on politician Y S Rajasekhar Reddy's padayatra hits theatres today amid a baggage of expectations.</li>
        <li>Starring Mammootty, Ashrita Vemuganti, Rao Ramesh in lead roles, here's how the film fares in the first hour</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Drawbacks :</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>All in all, Yatra has share of its goods and weak moments with loopholes in scripting and execution, lacked on emotions and drama.</li>
        <li>More importantly, showing Congress High Command as villains is a silly stuff.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Finally,Congratulations mahi raghav sir..The way u deal with yatra subject was superb..mamooty(the face of indian cinema) given his one of the best performance in yatra movie, especially his dialogue delivery in telugu is terrific..YSR the name itself an emotion in telugu people hearts, mahi sir u grabbed that</h3>
